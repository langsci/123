\addchap{Preface}

This book is a revised version of my doctoral thesis, defended at the university of Konstanz on the 22\textsuperscript{nd} of April 2016 \citep[see][]{GutmanThesis}. As a supporter of the open access philosophy, it is a great honour for me to publish it with Language Science Press. I thank \name{Martin}{Haspelmath}, the editor-in-chief, for his encouragement and acceptance of the book. 

The next section reproduces verbatim the acknowledgements of my doctoral dissertation. I would like to add to these my sincere thanks to \name{Sebastian}{Nordhoff} for his editorial support and his invaluable contribution in drawing the two maps which adorn the book.

I would also like to thank the three anonymous reviewers of the manuscript. Although I could not follow amply all their suggestions due to unfortunate time constraints, their comments permitted me to clarify and 
correct some points, elaborate on others, altogether making this a better book. Reading the reviews, moreover, was a great pleasure. I would like to thank especially one reviewer who described my thesis as \enquote{a truly bewildering study but also very fascinating}. Reading these sweet words made the entire enterprise worth its while.
